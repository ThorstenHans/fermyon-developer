Fermyon Cloud now supports setting application variables through the API. Spin supports dynamic application variables. Instead of being static, their values can be updated without modifying the application, creating a simpler experience for rotating secrets, updating API endpoints, and more. These variables are defined in a Spin application manifest (in the `[variables]` section) and are provided by a configuration provider.

Now, when your application is deployed to Fermyon Cloud you can set and update variables for it using the `spin cloud variables` command. You can also set the variables when you initially deploy the application using `spin cloud deploy --variables`. The `spin cloud variables` command can also be used to list variables that have been set for an application. For a full explanation of how to configure variables and secrets in Spin applications, read the new [tutorial](../../cloud/variables.md).
